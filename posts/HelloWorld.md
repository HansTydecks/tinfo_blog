Most of the projects I do, I do out of enjoyment of the process. Sharing this process on the web in an old fashioned way like a blog serves multiple purposes. In the age of AI slop this way of generating and publishing even a sliver of handmade information feels like being part of a countermovement that had never ceased to exist in the first place. To many, creating and share on the web has and will always be a source of pride and joy. I would like to see myself as one of those people and post more on the web.
